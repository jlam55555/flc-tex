\subsection{Core standard library}
\label{sec:core-stdlib}

These are a set of standard definitions that I found useful for exercises. They are not part of the ``prelude,'' i.e., the list of standard definitions builtin to the language as described in \Cref{sec:core-base}, so these definitions need to be loaded from a file.

\subsection{Project Euler 1}
\label{sec:core-pe1}

See \href{https://projecteuler.net/problem=1}{Project Euler 1}. This requires the standard library from \Cref{sec:core-stdlib}.
