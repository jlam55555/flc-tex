\subsection{Motivation and overview}
\label{sec:motivation}

This project was the semester-long project for the ECE491 independent study on advanced compilers. It is the implementation of a simple lazy (normal-order) evaluation functional language similar to Haskell. The work follows the tutorial, ``Implementing functional languages: a tutorial'' by Simon Peyton Jones at Microsoft Research \cite{jones2000implementing}. This was published two years after Haskell 1.0 was defined in 1990 \cite{hudak2007history}, to which SPJ was a major contributor.

This project is the culmination of my studies in programming languages and functional programming over the past two years. These studies include writing a C compiler in C (Spring 2021), a LISP interpreter in LISP (Summer 2021), and this project, a Core interpreter and compiler in Haskell (Spring 2022). Additionally, my Master's thesis (2021-2022 school year) was about updating the evaluation model of Hazel, a programming language implemented in OCaml. We can summarize these languages in \Cref{tab:pl-implementations-summary}.
